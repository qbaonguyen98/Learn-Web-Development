- Instead of putting markup (HTML) and logic (JS) in separate files. React separates app into "components" that contain both --> JSX

- React doesnâ€™t require using JSX, but it allows React to show more useful error and warning messages.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- You can put any valid JavaScript expression inside the curly braces in JSX --> called "Embedded Expression"

- You can use JSX inside of "if" statements and "for" loops, assign it to variables, accept it as arguments, and return it from functions

- You should either use quotes (for string values) or curly braces (for expressions) for attributes

- If a tag is empty, you may close it immediately with />
