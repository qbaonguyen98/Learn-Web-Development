## Advantages over RDBMS
    - Schema less / dynamic schema: In RDBMS, a record (row) has specified numbers of fields (columns). In MongoDB, number of fields, content and size of the document can differ from one document to another

    - Clear structure

    - No complex 'JOINS' operator

    - No need to convert application objects to database objects (because data is stored in the form of JSON style)
